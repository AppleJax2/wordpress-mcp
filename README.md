### 3. Connect to Claude Desktop

To use our WordPress automation tools in Claude Desktop:

#### Option 1: Remote Server Configuration (Recommended)

1. Open Claude Desktop application
2. Go to Settings > Developer
3. Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wordpress-mcp": {
      "url": "https://wordpress-mcp.onrender.com/sse-cursor",
      "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your provided API key
6. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

If you encounter the "invalid_type" error with the "command" field, use Option 2 below.

#### Option 2: Alternative Configuration Method

If Option 1 doesn't work, use this configuration that specifies how to connect to the remote server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wordpress-mcp": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-N",
        "-H", "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "https://wordpress-mcp.onrender.com/sse-cursor"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your provided API key, save the file, and restart Claude Desktop.

Once configured, you can ask Claude to perform WordPress and Divi tasks.

### 4. Connect to Cursor IDE

To add our WordPress automation tools to Cursor:

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Go to Settings > MCP Configuration
3. Add the following to your MCP configuration:

      "url": "https://wordpress-mcp.onrender.com/sse-cursor",
      "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your provided API key
5. Restart Cursor

Now you can ask the Cursor AI assistant to perform WordPress and Divi automation tasks.

## MCP Protocol Implementation

This server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses, following the MCP protocol flow:

1. Client connects to `/sse-cursor` to establish an SSE connection
2. Server responds with an event containing the message endpoint: `/message?sessionId=<UUID>`
3. Client sends JSON-RPC requests to the message endpoint
4. Server responds with a minimal HTTP acknowledgment and sends the actual response via the SSE channel

Supported JSON-RPC methods:
- `initialize` - Initialize the MCP session
- `tools/list` - Get a list of available WordPress tools
- `tools/call` - Call a WordPress tool with parameters
- `notifications/initialized` - Acknowledge client ready state

This implementation is compatible with standard MCP protocol clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor IDE.
