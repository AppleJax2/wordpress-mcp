REQUIRE_API_KEY=true (recommended for production)
HEADLESS=true (optional, for browser automation)
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=* (allows requests from any origin)
CORS_ALLOW_METHODS=GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS

OPENAI_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=128000

# Analytics Configuration
ANALYTICS_SAVE_INTERVAL_MS=300000
ANALYTICS_DETAILED_LOGGING=false
```

> **Important:** WordPress credentials (site URL, username, app password) are provided per-request by the TanukiMCP Dashboard plugin and should NOT be set as environment variables in production deployments. The server expects these credentials in the request body for each API call.

## Authentication

TanukiMCP uses a simplified authentication model:

1. **Master API Key**: All requests must include the master API key in the Authorization header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer 3c9a406341969edf38b3d6d0c8f7685c
   ```

2. **User Identification**: Each request should include the WordPress user ID in the request body:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": 123,
     "message": "Your request message"
   }
   ```

This approach simplifies authentication while still allowing usage tracking per WordPress user.

## OpenAI API Integration

TanukiMCP integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4.1 models to provide AI-powered WordPress site management. The server supports multiple model tiers:

- **GPT-4.1** (Default): The most capable model for complex WordPress tasks and coding
- **GPT-4.1 Mini**: A faster, more cost-effective model for simpler tasks
- **GPT-4.1 Nano**: The fastest, most economical option for basic tasks

The API integration provides:

1. WordPress expertise with deep knowledge of themes, plugins, and core functionality
2. Automated site editing and content management
3. Workflow automation for common WordPress tasks
4. Token usage tracking and analytics

Users can specify model preferences in their requests with the `model_preference` parameter:
- `advanced`: Uses the GPT-4.1 model
- `basic`: Uses the GPT-4.1-mini model
