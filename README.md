## MCP Protocol Implementation

This server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses, following the MCP protocol flow:

1. Client connects to `/sse-cursor` to establish an SSE connection
2. Server responds with an event containing the message endpoint: `/message?sessionId=<UUID>`
3. Client sends JSON-RPC requests to the message endpoint
4. Server responds with a minimal HTTP acknowledgment and sends the actual response via the SSE channel

Supported JSON-RPC methods:
- `initialize` - Initialize the MCP session
- `tools/list` - Get a list of available WordPress tools
- `tools/call` - Call a WordPress tool with parameters
- `notifications/initialized` - Acknowledge client ready state

This implementation is compatible with standard MCP protocol clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor IDE.
