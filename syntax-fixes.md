# Syntax Fixes

This document outlines the syntax issues that were fixed in the codebase to resolve deployment failures.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Improper Apostrophe in inspiration-tool.js

In `src/tools/inspiration-tool.js`, two strings contained smart apostrophes inside single-quoted strings:

```js
// Before (line 314)
excerpt: 'Let's face it – we could all use a few shortcuts in our digital lives. Whether you're drowning in emails or just can't find that file you saved yesterday, these game-changing tech hacks will save you tons of time and frustration...'

// Fixed

```

```js
// Before (line 324)
title: 'I Tried These Viral Productivity Methods So You Don't Have To'

// Fixed

```

### 2. Improper Apostrophe in business-plan-tool.js

In `src/tools/business-plan-tool.js`, there were two strings with similar issues:

```js
// Before (line 422)
'We're committed to customer satisfaction and ongoing support'

// Fixed
"We're committed to customer satisfaction and ongoing support"
```

```js
// Before (line 467)
{ name: 'Display Advertising', description: 'Revenue from ads displayed on site', implementation: 'Implement strategic ad placements that don't detract from user experience' }

// Fixed
{ name: 'Display Advertising', description: 'Revenue from ads displayed on site', implementation: "Implement strategic ad placements that don't detract from user experience" }
```

## Verification

All files now pass a syntax check and can be loaded and instantiated without errors. A test script (`test-all-tools.js`) was created to verify that all tool files in the codebase can be loaded without syntax errors.

## Root Cause

The root cause of these issues was the use of smart/curly apostrophes (`'`) in single-quoted string literals. JavaScript interprets these as separate characters, causing syntax errors.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use double quotes (`"`) for strings containing apostrophes
2. Or escape apostrophes with a backslash (`\'`) in single-quoted strings
3. Consider using a linter to catch these issues during development
